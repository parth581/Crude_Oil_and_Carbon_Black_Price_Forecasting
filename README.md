# AI-Driven Short and Medium-Term Crude Oil & Carbon Black Price Forecasting

## üîç Overview
This project is a comprehensive solution designed to predict **short- and medium-term prices** of **Crude Oil** and **Carbon Black**, two of the most volatile and industrially significant commodities. Leveraging the power of **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **hybrid ensemble models**, the system delivers high-accuracy, real-time price forecasts that aid industries in **cost optimization, procurement planning, and risk mitigation**.

The models are built and trained using both **historical and real-time data** on crude oil and natural gas, which are key inputs for carbon black production. This project is particularly beneficial for sectors like **automotive, plastics, rubber, and coatings**, where raw material price stability is crucial.

## üéØ Objectives
- Accurately forecast **Crude Oil** prices using time series and ML-based models.
- Predict **Carbon Black** prices using upstream commodity forecasts (Crude Oil & Natural Gas).
- Enable **real-time forecasting** adaptability.
- Compare and evaluate model performance using metrics like **RMSE**, **MAPE**, and **R-squared**.
- Support industry-level decision-making through robust predictive analytics.

## ü§ñ Models Implemented
### Individual Models:
- **SVR (Support Vector Regression)**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**
- **XGBoost**

### Hybrid Models:
- **GRU + AdaBoost**
- **GRU + XGBoost**
- **LSTM + AdaBoost**
- **LSTM + XGBoost**

### MultiModal Models (for Carbon Black):
